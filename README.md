**Quantica** is a high-performance, compiled programming language designed for the next generation of computing: **Quantum-Classical Hybrid** workflows. Written in Rust and powered by LLVM, it features native quantum primitives, sparse state simulation, and a syntax built for scientists and engineers.

##  Why Quantica?

Most quantum languages are just Python libraries. Quantica is a **compiled language** where quantum gates, measurements, and circuits are first-class citizens.

* **Native Quantum Syntax:** Allocate registers (`quantum q[2]`) and apply gates (`apply Hadamard(q[0])`) directly in the language.
* **Hybrid Runtime:** Mix classical logic (`if`, `while`, `functions`) with quantum state manipulation seamlessly.
* **Gate Modifiers:** Dynamically apply `dagger` (inverse) and `controlled` modifiers to *any* gate or circuit.
* **LLVM Backend:** Compiles to highly optimized native machine code via LLVM 18 for maximum performance.
* **Package Management:** Built-in support for modules and packages via `import` and `from` syntax.

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Windows Installer (Recommended)
For the easiest setup, download the pre-built installer from our latest release.

1.  Go to the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/Quantica-Foundation/quantica-lang/releases)**.
2.  Download **`QuanticaInstaller-v0.1.1-alpha.exe`**.
3.  Run the installer to set up Quantica and add it to your system PATH automatically.

### Option 2: Build from Source
If you are on Linux/macOS or prefer building from source, you will need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and LLVM 18 installed.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/Quantica-Foundation/quantica-lang.git](https://github.com/Quantica-Foundation/quantica-lang.git)
cd quantica-lang

# 2. Build the compiler (release mode recommended for performance)
cargo build --release

# 3. The executable will be at ./target/release/quantica
Add this folder to your PATH or copy the binary to /usr/local/bin
```
## Known Limitations
- Match expressions incomplete (use if/elif/else)
- Try/finally not implemented (try/catch works)
- JIT mode experimental (use interpreter or AOT)

## ⭐ If you like this project, consider giving it a star!

## ⚠️Hey everyone! Quantica is still experimental, so you may run into bugs, weird behaviors, missing features, or syntax that changes suddenly. We’re building fast, researching fast, and sometimes breaking things fast. Feel free to play with it, test ideas, and let us know what breaks — your feedback directly shapes the language! Just keep in mind that things may change quickly as the project evolves.
